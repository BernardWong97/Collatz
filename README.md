## Collatz conjecture

### A simple python program to refresh memory on how to setup conda python and git

Collatz conjecture  is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: 
- Start with any positive integer n.
- Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
    - If the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. 
    - If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.

The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
